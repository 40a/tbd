## No Code Freeze

Developers living in a Trunk Based Development reality, mostly don't experience variance in their days or weeks on the 
trunk. In particular there's no "we're close to a release so let's freeze code", and generally there's no indication 
of a slow down in proximity to a release.  Sure, a couple of devs out a team might be assigned to bug-fixing closer
to the release but everyone else is going to work at full speed.

### Every Day is the same

Ignoring meetings, Developers commit/push at the same rate regardless of the day of the week or the week of the month.
