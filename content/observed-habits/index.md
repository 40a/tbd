## No Code Freeze

Developers living in a Trunk Based Development reality, mostly don't experience variance in their days or weeks on the 
trunk. In particular there's no "we're close to a release so let's freeze code", and generally there's no indication 
of a slow down in proximity to a release.  Sure, a couple of devs out a team might be assigned to bug-fixing closer
to the release but everyone else is going to work at full speed.

### Every Day is the same

Ignoring meetings, Developers commit/push at the same rate regardless of the day of the week or the week of the month. 

## Quick Reviews

Teams doing trunk based development, know that they their commits/pushes are up for the scrutiny by others, as soon
as they've landed on the shared trunk. They're keen bring that forward, not delay it, so they may prefer to 
pair-program on changes, or ask colleages for a code review at the time the change is submitted to be merged into
the trunk.
