## Microsoft's Git Virtual File System (2017)

![](to_tbd1.png)

Microsoft released ~~GitVFS~~ GVFS in early 2017 on GitHub{{< ext url="https://github.com/Microsoft/GVFS" >}}.

This new technology deserves time and analysis before the full impact is determined. There is a suggestion from Brian Harry's
blog{{< ext url="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/bharry/2017/02/07/more-on-gvfs" >}} that branch reduction was one of
the motivators.
