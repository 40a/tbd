[Continuous Integration](/continuous-integration/) (CI) has been in practice since the
mid-nineties in its modern incarnation (integrating to a shared code line frequently, and 
testing that).

[Continuous Delivery](/continuous-delivery/) (CD) is a layer on top of that, has been practiced since the mid-2000's, and 
documented in Jez Humble and Dave Farley's book of the same name in 2010.  This site gives a 5% summary of the 
practice. The reader should dive into the Book and associated site, without delay.

Lean Experiments can happen in any development team on any project but work **best** on foundations that 
are solid. Specifically, the solid foundations of Trunk Based Development, CI and CD. This site does not touch on 
Lean Experiments at all, but the reader should strive to understand that field
of science when the lower layers of the stylized cake are solid.

Importantly, the reader should understand that there is a large overlap between Trunk Based Development and 
Continuous Integration, as defined by its definers and documenters. Whereas Trunk Based Development focuses on a
pure source-control workflow and an individual contributor's obligations to that, Continuous Integration focuses 
equally on that and the need to have machines issue early warnings breakages and incompatibilities.

DevOps is encompassing too. At the very least, the expansion of developers habits into operations heartlands giving 
Infrastructure as Code, continual improvement experiments, a focus on time through the machine, the scripting of previously
manual operations things, goes further than we can represent in a stylized layer cake diagram, and indeed on this site.
