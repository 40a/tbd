[Continuous Integration](/continuous-integration/) has been in practice since the
mid 90's in its modern incarnation (integrating to a shared codeline frequently, and 
testing that).

[Continuous Delivery](/continuous-delivery/) is a layer on top of that, has been practiced since the mid 00's, and 
documented in Jez Humble and Dave Farley's book of the same name in 2010.  This site give a 5% summary of the 
practice. The reader should dive into the Book and associated site, without delay.

Lean Experiments can really happen with any development team on any project, but works **best** on foundations that 
are solid. Specifically, the solid foundations of Trunk Based Development, Continuous Integration and Continuous
Delivery. This site doesn't touch on Lean Experiments at all, but the reader should strive to understand that field
of science when the lower layer of the stylized cake are solid.

Importantly, the reader should understand that there is a large overlap between Trunk Based Development and 
Continuous Integration, as defined by it's definers and documenters. Whereas Trunk Based Development focuses on a
pure source-control workflow and an individual contributor's obligations to that, Continous Integration focuses 
equally on that and the need to have early warnings breakages and incompatibilities.
