# Contribution rules

1. Contribute if you have something to add to the site.
2. Keep the message
multi-level (beginner, intermediate, advanced).
3. Understand that some
people are diametrically opposed to this, and if you're to convince them
at all, it will be very carefully.
4. No inflamed language, please.
5. Abide
by [the golden rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule) and
generally write according to 'High Esteem' value.
6. Links to Blog entries, tweets (etc) should go
in footnotes without forward links inline links
(or maybe move to a collapsed refs section - stick to chronalogical order
per section).
7. Links to mainstream books, and Gartner-style reports, inline.
Use affiliate codes that contribute to the original authors, if applicable.
